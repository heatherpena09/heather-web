<h2>Academic Background</h2>
<p>
  I began my academic journey in <strong>PREP (2012–2013)</strong> at Early Learning School,
  where I consistently ranked 1st overall.
</p>
<p>
  From <strong>2013 to 2019</strong> at Jose Rizal Elementary School, I was a consistent
  MTAP candidate from Grade 1 to Grade 6, earning top ranks every year and graduating
  as Salutatorian with High Honors. In Grades 4 and 5, I also became part of the Student
  Pupil Government, while in Grade 5 I discovered my passion for writing and joined the
  school paper, which I actively participated in until Grade 12. I also represented the
  school in various academic and journalism-related competitions.
</p>
<p>
  In <strong>Junior High School at Lakandula High School (2019–2023)</strong>, I was a
  consistent honor student from Grade 7 to Grade 10. I continued my involvement in the
  school paper and in different academic and journalistic contests, further strengthening
  my writing and communication skills.
</p>
<p>
  For <strong>Senior High School at Colegio de San Juan de Letran (2023–2025)</strong>,
  I pursued the STEM strand, maintained strong academic performance, and remained active
  in the school paper organization. My participation in journalism activities allowed me
  to continuously improve my skills in writing and reporting.
</p>
<p>
  Now in my <strong>first year of college at the Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Maynila (2025)</strong>,
  I still aspire to join Ang Pamantasan, the university’s official publication, to continue
  nurturing my passion for journalism. While I originally intended to pursue Psychology or
  Medicine-related courses, I am currently enrolled in the Bachelor of Science in Computer Science,
  where I continue to adapt, explore, and challenge myself academically while keeping my strong
  interest in writing and communication alive.
